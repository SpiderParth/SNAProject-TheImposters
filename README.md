# SNAProject-TheImposters
This repository contains the SNA projects made by The Imposters.

## Datasets
You can choose two data sets from the below links (both having several options).
1. http://konect.uni-koblenz.de
2. https://snap.stanford.edu/data/
If the first first link is not working please try this: http://konect.cc/

## Project Goals
Once you fix the datasets you have to SOLVE TWO PROBLEMS for both the two dataset separately:
1. Find all centrality measures, clustering coefficients (both local and global) and reciprocity and transitivity that we have studied in the class using appropriate algorithms (you may use specific packages for this or write your own algorithm for the same).
2. Try to get an algorithm package in Python to find the maximum connected component (called a giant component in the class) in a given graph G. Let us denote the number of nodes in the giant component of a graph G as N_G. Vary ⟨k⟩ from 0 to 5 with increment of 0.1. For each value of ⟨k⟩ find the ratio N_G/N where N is the number of nodes in the graph. Plot this ratio with respect to ⟨k⟩. Take ⟨k⟩ as x-axis and ratio N_G/N as y-axis.

We've chose to work with:-
1. the Social Circles Facebook network: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/ego-Facebook.html
2. the email-Eu-core network: https://snap.stanford.edu/data/email-Eu-core.html
